This material is covered by the Poetic License 1.0, thus containing Francisco Bentois' ethical-aesthetic invitation: to share from the seed to the shade. The objective is to encourage the flow of sharing materials and creative processes in order to encourage increasingly creative, intimate, synergistic and resource-rich agglutinations - that is, that are fertile to build vibrant cultures.

The material or creative process
can be of any type, at any stage of development and of any complexity.
Examples: a new musical instrument; a sequence of steps to obtain a visual effect - or sonic, or scenic...; a score; a mixing technique; new software or a modification; a tool; a compositional procedure; an audio; an image; an algorithm; a video/audio/other media project complete with its parameters, media resources and ancillary software included and ready to use; a map of improvisation...

You that are going to use this material in some work
are invited and strongly encouraged to the ethics of not just using it, but also inviting the author of the material/process to participate in the work as an artist to some degree or establish a related partnership.
Examples: When using a Pure Data patch to record a song, you invite the author of the patch to record an instrument on it or participate in it. Or you include within your album in question a song composed by the author of the material/process. Or you invite the author to co-create a new work.
In addition, you are also welcome to *strongly cite* the author when using the material. By citing strongly, it is understood to disclose the author as far as is reasonable. For example, when videotaping a presentation using an improvisational process, you can provide a hyperlink to the author's website.

The spiritual implications of the breach of the ethics described above are still unknown to Science.

You can modify this material
at will in whole or in part, including obligatorily a copy of this license and the attribution of the author. If this modification itself constitutes artistic material, the aforementioned ethical-aesthetic invitation by Bentois also applies.

Any type of use of this material implies the attribution of the author and inclusion of a copy of this license, clearly informed in the presentation material of the work - examples: back of physical media, video description text, audiovisual work credits.

This license does not permit the commercialization of the material as a whole or in the form of a separate autonomous part, although it does not prohibit its incorporation in derivative commercial materials, respecting the terms of the license.

The author owes no guarantee or liability in relation to the use of the material and any consequences of such use.
